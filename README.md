# Power-Portal
While there are a large number of individuals and organizations working for the cause of womenâ€™s empowerment, many struggle to find support in terms of finance as well as the right kind of human resources. On the other hand, there are also many individuals and companies that are willing to provide their time and support to these causes/projects. A platform which connects these two sets of people can encourage many initiatives for gender equality, which would otherwise not be able to get off the ground. An online platform may be developed to facilitate this interaction, while maintaining a level of security for the users.
